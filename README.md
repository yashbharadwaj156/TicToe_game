# TicToe_game
In this repository I will create a Tic Toe game with the help of CPP. In future , I will try to use the comibned concept of c++ classes and computer graphics functions to enhanced the application.
# Tic tac Toe
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English and British English), or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies” (Ireland), is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. 
To place an X on a square, answer the question correctly. After your turn, your opponent will place an O on the board. Get three X's in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) before your opponent gets three O's in a row to win the game.

# strategy
1-Win: If the player has two in succession, they can put a third to get three in succession. 

2-Block: If the adversary has two in succession, the player should play the actual third to obstruct the rival. 

Fork: Cause a situation where the player has two different ways to win (two non-hindered lines of 2). 

Impeding a rival's fork: If there is just a single conceivable fork for the adversary, the player should hinder it. Something else, the player should hinder all forks in any capacity that at the same time permits them to make two in succession. Something else, the player should make a two straight to drive the adversary into shielding, as long as it doesn't bring about them creating a fork. For instance, if "X" has two inverse corners and "O" has the middle, "O" should not play a corner move to win. (Playing a corner move in this situation delivers a fork for "X" to win.) 

3-Center: A player denotes the middle. (In case it is the principal move of the game, playing a corner move offers the subsequent player more chances to commit an error and may in this way be the better decision; notwithstanding, it has no effect between amazing players.) 

4-Inverse corner: If the rival is in the corner, the player plays the contrary corner. 

5-Emptycorner: The player plays in a corner square. 

6-Empty side: The player plays in a center square on any of the four sides.
